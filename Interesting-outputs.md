## Input: The fastest and easiest way to build server side of web application

*There are several ways to build the server-side of a web application, but the fastest and easiest approach would depend on your specific requirements and preferences. Here are some popular options:*

*1. Use a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform: BaaS platforms like Firebase, Parse, and Kinvey provide a pre-built backend infrastructure that you can use to quickly develop and deploy your web application. These platforms typically offer features like user authentication, data storage, and serverless functions that you can use to handle your application's server-side logic.*

*2. Use a web framework: Web frameworks like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Django provide a set of tools and libraries that make it easier to build the server-side of a web application. These frameworks offer features like routing, middleware, and templating engines that can help you quickly develop and deploy your application.*

*3. Use a content management system (CMS): If your web application requires content management features like blogging, e-commerce, or social networking, using a CMS like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla can be a quick and easy way to build the server-side of your application. These CMS platforms provide pre-built modules and plugins that you can use to add the functionality you need.*

*4. Use a cloud platform: Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure provide a range of tools and services that can help you quickly develop and deploy your web application. These platforms offer features like serverless functions, containerization, and auto-scaling that can help you build a robust and scalable server-side infrastructure.*

*Ultimately, the fastest and easiest way to build the server-side of your web application will depend on your specific requirements, technical expertise, and resources. It's important to carefully evaluate your options and choose the approach that best meets your needs.*

## Which technology is the best for building web application, explain like gangster

*Yo, listen up homie. When it comes to building web apps, there's a lotta tech out there to choose from, but I gotta tell ya, there's one that reigns supreme like the godfather of programming languages. And that's none other than... drumroll... JavaScript, my friend.*

*JavaScript is the OG, the OG of web development. It's versatile, powerful, and can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. It's like a trusty sidekick that's always got your back. And don't even get me started on the frameworks and libraries built on top of JavaScript. React, Angular, Vue...these are some heavy hitters that'll make building web apps a breeze.*

*But yo, let's not forget about the backend. When it comes to that, we gotta give props to Node.js. It's like the don of backend tech, allowing you to use JavaScript on the server side too. And with its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, it's lightning fast, like a getaway car on a heist.*

*So, to sum it up, if you wanna build web apps like a real gangsta, you gotta use JavaScript and Node.js. It's like having a crew of expert hackers on your side. Ain't no one gonna mess with you then.*
